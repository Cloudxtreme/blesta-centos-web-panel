# blesta-centos-web-panel
Blesta Module for Cent Os Web Panel

=== THIS IS A NON WORKING VERSION ===

== What is expected to be working
= Add a server
= Remove a server
= Validate the api key against centos web server

I stoped when found an error on add a service with

"An internal error occurred. The module row is unavailable."

Since i cant run x-debug on the blesta, im kind of stuck.

Thanks, if possible updates will come soon.
